# Setup

## Dependencies

If you use [nix](https://nixos.org), a flake is here for you. Activate the environment with `direnv allow` and you will get the right versions of everything and a VScode already configured with all the extensions.

Otherwise, you will need the following:
- rustup (v1.25.1)
- cargo (v1.64.0)
- rustfmt (v1.5.1-stable)
- Your code editor of choice
  - If you use VScode, we suggest you to install these extensions so that you can use our launch configurations (when you open the directory, you will get an automatic prompt to install them in one click):
    - `rust-lang.rust-analyzer`
    - `vadimcn.vscode-lldb`

## Connect to the VPN
1. Ping `advancedprogramming.disi.unitn.it`. This should fail since you'll need to connect to University of Trento's VPN to access `advancedprogramming.disi.unitn.it`

1.  Open the GlobalProtect VPN client by running `sudo gpclient` (be sure to follow the setup instructions from the [official repo](https://github.com/yuezk/GlobalProtect-openconnect))

1.  Enter as portal address `vpn.icts.unitn.it`

1.  The username is your unitn email without the "studenti" subdomain -e.g., `mario.rossi@unitn.it`-

1.  The password is your unitn password

1.  The VPN will show the status 'Connected'.

1.  Now you should be able to successfully ping `advancedprogramming.disi.unitn.it`

## Add your auth token to be able to fetch from Kellnr

1. Create a file `.env` with the same contents of `.env.sample` (to do so, you can run `cp .env.sample .env`).

1. Add the token you have received by mail from tech.disi@unitn.it in date 20/10/22 in the `.env`.

1. Note that previously active shells/terminal emulators may not pick up automatically the new environment variable and you may need to restart them.

1. `cd` in a crate and run a `cargo update` to confirm you have access to `kellnr`.

## Price change logic

The market goes in **seasons**. More specifically, each good changes accordingly to its season, independently from the others.
A season can last from 20 to 365 days.
At the start of the season, the market decides a target price, which can be 

## Market keeps

Good is standardized and has kind and quantity
`goods`: a hashmap of the goods it has (stored as association GoodKind->Good
`locked_goods`: same as `goods`, but keeps as quantity the locked quantity
-> Need to update `locked_goods` every day!
